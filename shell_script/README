Manual command shell script

arhyas_command.sh: the main script

data files:
the prefix with '_' comma delimited '.csv' files are the prayer texts components
the argument to the main script is a file with just a list of ip addresses, also in comma delimited form:

xxx, <ip address>, xxx 
bbb, <ip address>, bbb

the main script cares about the second column, the rest could be garbage, however they need to be the format stated with comma separating the columns

example file and how it runs: ./arhyas_command.sh www.skpye.com.traceroute.txt

So the call dependencies are: arhyas_command.sh -> read.sh -> csv files of prayer text + the target network

Prepare the system by installing GNU parallel:

sudo apt install parallel

macOS example:

brew install parallel


Then make sure to have the following new additional scripts in the same shell_script directory:

tracelist.sh   (This script decouple the function of filtering ip address to one module)
arhyas_msg.sh  (This is the script being parallelized)
arhyas_command_parallel.sh (This is the new master script)

./arhyas_command_parallel.sh www.youtube.com

example:
./arhyas_command_parallel.sh www.youtube.com
