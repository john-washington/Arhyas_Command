Manual command shell script

arhyas_command.sh: the main script

data files:
the prefix with '_' comma delimited '.csv' files are the prayer texts components
the argument to the main script is a file with just a list of ip addresses, also in comma delimited form:

xxx, <ip address>, xxx 
bbb, <ip address>, bbb

the main script cares about the second column, the rest could be garbage, however they need to be the format stated with comma separating the columns

example file and how it runs: ./arhyas_command.sh www.skpye.com.traceroute.txt

So the call dependencies are: arhyas_command.sh -> read.sh -> csv files of prayer text + the target network


Version 2 date: 9-18-2025

This version combined the traceroute and the arhyas_command into one script, so no manual editing is needed.

To run it:

./arhyas_command2.sh <ip address>

or

./arhyas_command2.sh <web address>

./arhyas_command2.sh www.youtube.com
