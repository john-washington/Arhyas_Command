Key Differences and Notes:
Hex Conversion: Windows doesn't have od command, so I used PowerShell for hex conversion
Ping Pattern: Windows ping doesn't support -p (pattern) option like Linux. The script uses regular ping
Timeout: Used -w 15000 for 15-second timeout (similar to your 15-second timeout)
Random Sleep: Uses %random% %% 60 for 0-59 second random sleep
CSV Parsing: Uses for /f with comma delimiter to parse CSV
Error Handling: Includes file existence check and proper error messages
Alternative Versions:
ping_csv.bat: First attempt with certutil-based hex conversion
ping_csv_simple.bat: Simplified version without hex conversion
Usage:
ping_csv_advanced.bat data.csv 192.168.1.1
Batch
The script will:

Read the CSV file line by line
Convert each field to hex (using PowerShell)
Ping the target host
Sleep for random time (0-59 seconds)
Continue with next line
Note: Windows ping doesn't support sending custom hex patterns in the ping payload like Linux does. If you need that functionality, you would need to use a different tool or PowerShell script.
